# Arkanoid-Game

## Explanation of the project:
Arkanoid is a block breaker video game.<br />
In Arkanoid, players maneuver a paddle-shaped craft named the Vaus along the bottom of the screen.<br />
The player controls the "Vaus", a space vessel that acts as the game's "paddle" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field,<br />
and attempts to bounce the ball against a number of bricks. <br />
The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player advances to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears.<br />
